= Expected Outcomes
// Describe the experiments you will run and the results you expect (or hope) to get at the end. (In the end, it’s fine if your results do not match these expectations—this is research after all—but you must articulate a hypothesis.)


By using the two techniques we highlighted above, we hope to obtain comparable performance on HumanEval/MBPP to the Code Llama - Python 13B model with a significantly smaller model.\
\
This will involve obtaining pass@1, and pass@10 metrics on the HumanEval/MBPP datasets for each improvement discussed above.
