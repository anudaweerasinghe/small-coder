// Succinctly identify how much time you spent on each of the various stages of the project. For example, include a table with hours spent on each of: reading papers/dataset websites/etc, reading code documentation (e.g. from PyTorch or Torchvision), understanding code from an existing implementation, compiling/running existing code, modifying existing code to do something new (or writing new code from scratch), writing scripts to run experiments, running experiments, compiling results, writing this document, etc.
